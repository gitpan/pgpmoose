PGPMoose is a program for scanning a newsgroup and deleting any posts
that were not signed by the moderator.  Instructions are available by 
running 'pgpmoose -h'.

INSTALLATION
============

Requirements:

  - A Unix-based system (it may work under Windows, but I doubt it)
  - Perl 5 or higher - http://www.perl.org/
  - NewsLib - http://www.killfile.org/~tskirvin/software/newslib/ 
      requires News::Article, Net::NNTP, and PGP::Sign, all of which 
      are available on CPAN - http://www.cpan.org/
  - GnuPG - http://www.gnupg.org/ (or similar PGP-type program)

Instructions:

-1. Make sure you're the moderator of the groups you've said you're
    moderating, and that all outgoing posts have a valid attached PGP
    signature.  You may want to do this with the pgp_sign() function 
    in the News::Article module.  
0.  Find a news server that accepts cancels and will let you inject your
    posts into them.  Make sure that you've asked specifically!  
1.  Customize the script by hand to match your local system.
2.  Retrieve the PGP signature for the groups you're following.  Enter
    them into your keyring.
3.  Set up the newsgroup you want to use with 'pgpmoose -s GROUP'
4.  Make some test runs with 'pgpmoose -t', to make sure only the posts
    that should be cancelled are cancelled.
5.  Put the regular program into your crontab, running every so often
    (nightly or twice-daily is recommended).  Review the logs in your
    email.
